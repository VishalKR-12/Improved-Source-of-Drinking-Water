## üìå Problem Statement

Access to safe and improved sources of drinking water remains a major challenge in India, particularly in rural and underdeveloped areas. Despite progress under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), disparities in accessibility persist across states and socio-economic groups.

This project leverages data from the 78th Round of the Multiple Indicator Survey (MIS) to analyze access to improved drinking water and related factors such as clean cooking fuel usage and migration patterns. The goal is to uncover actionable insights that support data-driven policy interventions and equitable access to clean water.

## ‚úÖ Proposed Solution

We designed an **AI-powered analytics platform** to analyze water accessibility trends across India using MIS data. The platform provides interactive dashboards and predictive analytics to assist in strategic decision-making.

### Key Components:
- **Data Integration:**  
  - MIS dataset from AI Kosh  
  - Supplementary data: cooking fuel usage, migration trends

- **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:**  
  - Handling missing/inconsistent data  
  - Composite indicators for water access, sanitation, and socio-economic dimensions  
  - Temporal and geographic clustering features

- **Machine Learning Techniques:**  
  - Classification models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)  
  - Clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN)  
  - Correlation analysis between water access and other indicators

- **Deployment on IBM Cloud:**  
  - IBM Watson Studio (model training & notebook execution)  
  - IBM Cloud Object Storage (data storage)  
  - IBM Cloud Functions (serverless analytics)  
  - IBM Cognos Analytics (interactive dashboards)

## üß† Algorithm & Deployment

### Algorithm Summary:
- **GroupBy Aggregation:** Proportion calculations
- **Chi-Square Analysis:** Statistical relationships (e.g., migration vs water access)
- **K-Means Clustering:** Grouping similar regions by access levels (optional)

### Data Input:
- Fields from MIS dataset:  
  - Drinking water source, cooking fuel type, migration details  
  - State, region, income class

### ML Pipeline:
1. Preprocess & clean dataset  
2. Encode categorical data  
3. Normalize using Min-Max scaling  
4. Apply clustering (Elbow Method, Silhouette Score for validation)  
5. Generate predictive insights & visualization

### Deployment:
- All notebooks hosted on IBM Watson Studio  
- Results made accessible via a Flask web app or IBM Cloud Functions  
- Artifacts stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage

## üìä Results

- Dataset used: `nss_items_data.csv`  
- AutoAI selected **Pipeline 4** for best regression results  
- Deployed under the title **"Drinking Water"**  
- Generated predictions and visualization of water access across regions  
- Provided data-driven policy insights via an interactive dashboard

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

### Key Findings:
- Detected significant **state-wise disparities** in drinking water access  
- Established **correlations** between clean cooking fuel usage and migration  
- Identified **vulnerable groups** (rural and low-income households) with poor access

### Challenges:
- Incomplete and inconsistent entries in MIS dataset  
- Complex categorical encoding  
- Lack of ground-truth labels for supervised evaluation

### Implementation Success:
- IBM Cloud services ensured smooth development and deployment  
- Open-source tools and APIs enabled efficient data analysis and insight generation
